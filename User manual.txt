This is the user manual for the TramSim simulation package. Some general notes:
- LINUX and Mac are currently not supported.
- Each run of a simulation will create roughly 2MB of data. Keep this in mind when doing large batch runs.


CODE FILES
All code needed to compile the TramSim package is found in the following five code files
Program.cs
iHasRails.cs
Tram.cs
Misc.cs
Event.cs

PARAMETER FILES
The simulation package uses several parameter files. Apart from initfile.ini, these names can be changed.

initfile.ini
CSToUithofdistr.txt
UithofToCSdistr.txt
DrivingParam.txt
DistrStations.txt
ExitProbs.txt



HOW TO USE
After compiling the tramsim.exe file, it should be placed so that the following file structure holds:

TramSim.Exe
FOLDER
	initfile.ini
	CSToUithofdistr.txt
	UithofToCSdistr.txt
	DrivingParam.txt
	DistrStations.txt
	ExitProbs.txt

When executing the program, it will ask for the name of the folder. Provide the name of FOLDER, followed by a '\'. It will then run simulations using the parameters provided in the parameter files in FOLDER. It will create a separate folder for data files per run performed.
Per station, several data files will be created, as well as some for each tram. An explanation per file follows.

activityLogTram.csv 
	Debugging file. 
	Contains major event which have happened to this tram, as well as positions of these events.
STATIONNAMEDwellTime.csv
	Shows per departure (time in seconds since start of simulation) how long it has been since the tram arrived at that station.
STATIONNAMEIntDepTime.csv
	Shows per departure how long it has been since the last departure.
STATIONNAMEPassDistr.csv
	Debugging file.
	Shows per time interval the expected number of passengers arriving per second.
STATIONNAMEPassWaiting.csv
	Shows per departure the number of passengers waiting at a station and the number of passengers in the tram.
STATIONNAMEPunctuality.csv
	Endstation only
	Shows per departure deviation from the schedule
STATIONNAMESchedule.txt
	debuggin file.
	Endstation only
	Shows the times at which trams are scheduled to depart from this station.
STATIONNAMETramsWaiting.csv
	Shows per tram arrival the numbers of tram waiting to enter the station, as well as the number of trams at the station.
STATIONNAMEWaitingTime.csv
	Shows per end of passenger embarkation the number of passengers waiting at the start of embarkation, how long these have been waiting, the numbers of passengers which newly have arrived since the last passenger update, the time since the last passenger update and how many passengers are still waiting after embarkation has finished.
TRAM.csv
	debugging file
	shows when, where from and where to a tram has been moved
TRAMPassLog.csv
	Shows per time, per location the number of passengers entering and exiting a tram.
